## Known Issues

### FT-03: Zoom Levels Not Progressive
**Severity**: Medium — navigation confusion

**Symptom**: A waypoint visible at one zoom level can vanish at the next. The current radii (50m, 100m, 500m, 1km, 5km) are not geometric multiples of each other — jumps alternate between 2× and 5×. A waypoint near the outer ring of 100m zoom may fall outside the distance filter threshold for 500m zoom.

**Proposed fix**: Replace with a geometric progression where each step is a fixed multiplier (e.g. ×3 or ×4): 50m → 150m → 500m → 1500m → 5000m. Every waypoint visible at zoom N would be visible at N+1, just further from centre.

**Also affects**: Grid line spacing, off-screen indicator distance filter multiplier.

**Key file**: `include/ui/ui_manager.h` — `RadarConfig::ZOOM_CONFIGS[]`

### FT-05: On/Off-Screen Boundary Duplicate Indicator
**Severity**: Low — edge case visual glitch

**Symptom**: As a waypoint crosses from off-screen to on-screen, both the yellow dot and the orange off-screen arrow briefly appear simultaneously.

**Root cause**: Off-screen sector assignment occurs before the on-screen clip check. Waypoints exactly at the boundary pixel satisfy both conditions.

**Fix**: Strict boundary guard in `drawWaypoints()` — only add to off-screen sector if `x < 0 || x >= screen_size || y < 0 || y >= screen_size` (exclusive bounds check). One-line fix.

**Key file**: `src/ui/navigation.cpp` — `drawWaypoints()`

## Planned

### Beacon Advertising Interval Note
The beacon proximity system is most responsive when the target beacon advertises at a short interval (~100ms). Longer advertising intervals (500ms+) cause noticeable lag between physical proximity change and RSSI update. Consider documenting the recommended beacon configuration in `docs/beacon_proximity.md`.

## Resolved

### FT-01: Button Double-Tap Unresponsive — Resolved (2026-03-20)
**Was**: Double-tap to reverse zoom unreliable, felt unresponsive under load.
**Resolution**: NimBLE migration freed ~40KB SRAM that was exhausted by the Bluedroid BLE stack. Heap stalls that disrupted button state machine timing are gone. Double-press detection now reliable.

---

### FT-04: Beacon Sound Choppy at Close Range — Resolved (2026-03-25)
**Was**: Buzzer pattern stuttered at 50m zoom when near a beacon.
**Resolution**: Beacon sonar reworked to a 4-zone musical tempo system (VERY_FAR 1500ms / FAR 750ms / MEDIUM 500ms / CLOSE 250ms) with EMA smoothing, hysteresis, and trend detection. NimBLE migration also resolved the underlying SRAM pressure that caused I2C contention on EXIO buzzer writes.

## Won't Fix

### FT-02: Compass Zoom-Dependent Smoothing
**Was**: At large zoom levels (1km, 5km) compass noise produces visible jitter.
**Decision**: Won't fix. Zoom-dependent EMA is not viable at 1Hz compass rate — heavy smoothing at large zoom would make the radar sluggish and unresponsive to real turns. At walking speeds and practical zoom levels the current 1Hz rate is acceptable. The correct long-term solution is a higher compass update rate (requires moving compass wires to Wire1 on GPIO19/20 for a dedicated I2C bus), not software smoothing.
